Done:

1. Build a way to create the 26 cubes.
    - They need to be in the correct orientation, with the correct sides colored.

2. Create way for user to rotate the Rubik's cube in X, Y, and Z directions.

3. Create 6 face objects, each with 9 cubes in a specific order.
    - I should create a specific order for the cubes, and have a function that assigns for each face its cubes (call it
    after each face rotation, after updating the cube order).

4. Create face rotations, where cubes move (including moving from one face to another).
    - Make this movement an animation.

5. Include a random move generator, with variable number of moves.
