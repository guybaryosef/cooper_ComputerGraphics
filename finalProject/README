Done:

1. Set up both a perspective and orthogonal projection views. We'll see later on which we will stick with.

2. Add basic interactive viewing so that we can spin 360 degrees about the cube.

3. Create a texture cube made up of solid colors.

4. Create a cube object that will show the reflection of the texture cube.

5. Fix the view so that we can see 360 degrees without anything getting cut off or weird.

6. Add different cube map pictures.

6.5 Make buttons to control the cube map pictures.

7. Make cubeMap appear as texture of the outer cube- what is known as a 'skybox'.

8. Add different shapes to be reflectors.

9. Make the inside cube a different color (glass-y / see through).

10. Add options to have the reflecting object rotate.

11. Add shapes flying through the air.

TODO:

12. Implement interactive viewing through mouse dragging.
